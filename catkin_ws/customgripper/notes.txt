#note 2
originally, the program is written for pyserial version 2.x (worked on 2.6.x. I got this from "sudo apt-get install python-serial" in ubuntu 14.04)

However, it does not work with the newest pyserial (version 3.4), which can be downloaded using "sudo pip install pyserial"

The reason: .setParity and .setstopbits are deprecated.

Hence, I edited the program to fit 3.4.
